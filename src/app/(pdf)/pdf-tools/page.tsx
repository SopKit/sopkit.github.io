## The Most Comprehensive Free PDF Suite Online
Stop paying for monthly subscriptions to simple PDF utilities. SopKit provides a professional-grade alternative to desktop software, allowing you to manipulate documents with surgical precision. 

### Privacy-First Browser Processing
We believe your documents belong to you. Our PDF suite is built using local-first technologies (PDF.js and PDF-Lib), meaning your files are never uploaded to a server. All merging, splitting, and conversion happens in your browser's secure sandbox.

### No Signup. No Limits. No Watermarks.
Unlike competitors who gate productivity behind paywalls and account creation, SopKit is committed to a frictionless experience. Download as many files as you need, whenever you need them.
