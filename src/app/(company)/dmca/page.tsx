								<p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
									sopkit.github.io (&quot;SopKit&quot;) respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (&quot;DMCA&quot;), we will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement committed using our service.

								<h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">2. Safe Harbor Statement</h2>
								<p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
									SopKit operates as a provider of online tools and does not host, store, or distribute copyrighted media files. Our downloader tools act as intermediaries that process publicly available URLs at the direction of users. We do not maintain a library of copyrighted content and do not encourage or facilitate copyright infringement.
								</p>
								<p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
									Many of our tools process files entirely in the user&apos;s browser, meaning SopKit never has access to or stores the processed content. For tools that use server-side processing, content is processed ephemerally and is not retained after the operation completes.
