# SopKit SEO and Monetization Plan

Updated: 2026-06-03

## Extremely Competitive Tools

These generic tools should stay live, but they should not be the main SEO bet for broad head terms:

- PDF Editor, PDF to Word, Word to PDF
- Image Compressor, Image Resizer, Background Remover
- QR Code Generator
- Word Counter, Character Counter
- JSON Formatter, JSON Validator
- Base64 Encoder/Decoder, URL Encoder/Decoder
- BMI Calculator, Age Calculator, Percentage Calculator
- Currency Converter, Mortgage Calculator, Loan Calculator
- YouTube Video Downloader, TikTok Downloader, Instagram Downloader
- MP4 to MP3
- AI Image Generator, Text to Speech

Why they are hard: SERPs are dominated by large utility brands, browser extensions, SaaS tools, ad-heavy incumbents, and high-authority domains with backlinks. SopKit should use these as parent utilities and route link equity toward exact-use pages.

## Low-Hanging-Fruit Keyword Map

Priority clusters implemented in code:

- Exam image tools: exact KB compression, SSC/UPSC/NEET/JEE pages, signature pages, cm/mm/DPI pages.
- Student calculators: attendance, safe class skipping, SGPA, CGPA, CGPA to percentage, required marks.
- API key testers: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, Resend, SendGrid, Stripe, Twilio.
- Small business QR and SEO tools: restaurant menu QR, Google Form QR, WiFi QR, UPI QR, Open Graph preview, meta description length.

## Pages Created Or Updated

New data/config:

- `src/data/seo-opportunities.ts`
- `src/data/tool-seo-inventory.ts`
- `src/data/monetization.ts`

New dynamic long-tail handling:

- Existing root intent route now serves standalone SEO opportunity pages such as `/compress-image-to-50kb`, `/openai-api-key-tester`, `/qr-code-for-restaurant-menu`, and `/meta-description-length-checker`.

New hub pages:

- `/exam-image-tools`
- `/student-calculators`
- `/student-tools`
- `/api-key-testers`
- `/qr-tools`
- `/small-business-tools`

Money pages:

- `/pro`
- `/api`
- `/advertise`
- `/services`
- `/hire` redirects to `/services`

Codebase fixes:

- Repaired malformed `src/constants/tools.json`.
- Added `npm run typecheck`.
- Added sitemap entries from real SEO opportunity data.
- Replaced hardcoded ad-risk rules with shared monetization policy.
- Added reusable exact-use SEO content blocks inside `ToolLayout`.

## Internal Linking Strategy

Generic high-competition pages should link to exact-use pages:

- Image Compressor -> 10KB, 20KB, 30KB, 50KB, signature, SSC, UPSC, cm/mm/DPI.
- QR Code Generator -> restaurant menu, Google Form, WiFi, UPI, business card, wedding invitation.
- Developer Tools -> API key tester hub and provider pages.
- Calculators -> student calculator hub, attendance, SGPA, CGPA, required marks.
- SEO Tools -> Open Graph preview checker and meta description length checker.

The reusable `SeoOpportunityContent` block renders related exact-use links from the central opportunity map.

## Monetization Strategy

Safe pages:

- Image tools
