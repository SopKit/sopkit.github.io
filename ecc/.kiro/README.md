# Everything Claude Code for Kiro

Bring [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/master/everything-claude-code) (ECC) workflows to [Kiro](https://kiro.dev). This repository provides custom agents, skills, hooks, steering files, and scripts that can be installed into any Kiro project with a single command.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Go to .kiro folder
cd .kiro

# Install to your project
./install.sh /path/to/your/project

# Or install to the current directory
./install.sh

# Or install globally (applies to all Kiro projects)
./install.sh ~
```

The installer uses non-destructive copy — it will not overwrite your existing files.

## What's Included

### Agents

Agents are specialized AI assistants with specific tool configurations.

**Format:**
- **IDE**: Markdown files (`.md`) - Access via automatic selection or explicit invocation
- **CLI**: JSON files (`.json`) - Access via `/agent swap` command

Both formats are included for maximum compatibility.

> **Note:** Agent models are determined by your current model selection in Kiro, not by the agent configuration.

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `planner` | Expert planning specialist for complex features and refactoring. Read-only tools for safe analysis. |
| `code-reviewer` | Senior code reviewer ensuring quality and security. Reviews code for CRITICAL security issues, code quality, React/Next.js patterns, and performance. |
| `tdd-guide` | Test-Driven Development specialist enforcing write-tests-first methodology. Ensures 80%+ test coverage with comprehensive test suites. |
| `security-reviewer` | Security vulnerability detection and remediation specialist. Flags secrets, SSRF, injection, unsafe crypto, and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. |
| `architect` | Software architecture specialist for system design, scalability, and technical decision-making. Read-only tools for safe analysis. |
| `build-error-resolver` | Build and TypeScript error resolution specialist. Fixes build/type errors with minimal diffs, no architectural changes. |
| `doc-updater` | Documentation and codemap specialist. Updates codemaps and documentation, generates docs/CODEMAPS/*, updates READMEs. |
| `refactor-cleaner` | Dead code cleanup and consolidation specialist. Removes unused code, duplicates, and refactors safely. |

| `chief-of-staff` | Executive assistant for project management, coordination, and strategic planning. |
| `go-build-resolver` | Go build error resolution specialist. Fixes Go compilation errors, dependency issues, and build problems. |

**Usage in IDE:**
- You can run an agent in `/` in a Kiro session, e.g., `/code-reviewer`.
- Kiro's Spec session has native planner, designer, and architects that can be used instead of `planner` and `architect` agents.

**Usage in CLI:**
1. Start a chat session
2. Type `/agent swap` to see available agents
3. Select an agent to switch (e.g., `code-reviewer` after writing code)
4. Or start with a specific agent: `kiro-cli --agent planner`

### Steering Files

Steering files provide always-on rules and context that shape how the agent works with your code.

| File | Inclusion | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `coding-style.md` | auto | Core coding style rules: immutability, file organization, error handling, and code quality standards. Loaded in every conversation. |
| `security.md` | auto | Security best practices including mandatory checks, secret management, and security response protocol. Loaded in every conversation. |
| `testing.md` | auto | Testing requirements: 80% coverage minimum, TDD workflow, and test types (unit, integration, E2E). Loaded in every conversation. |
| `development-workflow.md` | auto | Development process, PR workflow, and collaboration patterns. Loaded in every conversation. |
| `git-workflow.md` | auto | Git commit conventions, branching strategies, and version control best practices. Loaded in every conversation. |
| `patterns.md` | auto | Common design patterns and architectural principles. Loaded in every conversation. |
| `performance.md` | auto | Performance optimization guidelines and profiling strategies. Loaded in every conversation. |
| `lessons-learned.md` | auto | Project-specific patterns and learnings. Edit this file to capture your team's conventions. Loaded in every conversation. |
| `typescript-patterns.md` | fileMatch: `*.ts,*.tsx` | TypeScript-specific patterns, type safety, and best practices. Loaded when editing TypeScript files. |

Steering files with `auto` inclusion are loaded automatically. No action needed — they apply as soon as you install them.

To create your own, add a markdown file to `.kiro/steering/` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
inclusion: auto        # auto | fileMatch | manual
description: Brief explanation of what this steering file contains
fileMatchPattern: "*.ts"  # required if inclusion is fileMatch
---

Your rules here...
```

### Hooks

Kiro supports two types of hooks:

1. **IDE Hooks** - Standalone JSON files in `.kiro/hooks/` (for Kiro IDE)
2. **CLI Hooks** - Embedded in agent configurations (for `kiro-cli`)

#### IDE Hooks (Standalone Files)

These hooks appear in the Agent Hooks panel in the Kiro IDE and can be toggled on/off. Hook files use the `.kiro.hook` extension.

| Hook | Trigger | Action | Description |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `quality-gate` | Manual (`userTriggered`) | `runCommand` | Runs build, type check, lint, and tests via `quality-gate.sh`. Click to trigger comprehensive quality checks. |
| `typecheck-on-edit` | File edited (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`) | `askAgent` | Checks for type errors when TypeScript files are edited to catch issues early. |
| `console-log-check` | File edited (`*.js`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx`) | `askAgent` | Checks for console.log statements to prevent debug code from being committed. |
| `tdd-reminder` | File created (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`) | `askAgent` | Reminds you to write tests first when creating new TypeScript files. |
| `git-push-review` | Before shell command | `askAgent` | Reviews git push commands to ensure code quality before pushing. |
| `code-review-on-write` | After write operation | `askAgent` | Triggers code review after file modifications. |
| `auto-format` | File edited (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`) | `askAgent` | Checks for formatting issues and fixes them inline without spawning a terminal. |
| `extract-patterns` | Agent stops | `askAgent` | Suggests patterns to add to lessons-learned.md after completing work. |
| `session-summary` | Agent stops | `askAgent` | Provides a summary of work completed in the session. |
| `doc-file-warning` | Before write operation | `askAgent` | Warns before modifying documentation files to ensure intentional changes. |

**IDE Hook Format:**

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "hook-name",
  "description": "What this hook does",
  "when": {
    "type": "fileEdited",
    "patterns": ["*.ts"]
  },
  "then": {
    "type": "runCommand",
    "command": "npx tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

**Required fields:** `version`, `enabled`, `name`, `description`, `when`, `then`

**Available trigger types:** `fileEdited`, `fileCreated`, `fileDeleted`, `userTriggered`, `promptSubmit`, `agentStop`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`

#### CLI Hooks (Embedded in Agents)

CLI hooks are embedded within agent configuration files for use with `kiro-cli`.

**Example:** See `.kiro/agents/tdd-guide-with-hooks.json` for an agent with embedded hooks.

**CLI Hook Format:**

```json
{
  "name": "my-agent",
  "hooks": {
    "postToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "fs_write",
        "command": "npx tsc --noEmit"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Available triggers:** `agentSpawn`, `userPromptSubmit`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `stop`

See `.kiro/hooks/README.md` for complete documentation on both hook types.

### Scripts

Shell scripts used by hooks to perform quality checks and formatting.

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `quality-gate.sh` | Detects your package manager (pnpm/yarn/bun/npm) and runs build, type check, lint, and test commands. Skips checks gracefully if tools are missing. |
| `format.sh` | Detects your formatter (biome or prettier) and auto-formats the specified file. Used by formatting hooks. |

## Customization

All files are yours to modify after installation. The installer never overwrites existing files, so your customizations are safe across re-installs.

- **Edit agent prompts** in `.kiro/agents/*.json` to adjust behavior or add project-specific instructions
- **Modify skill workflows** in `.kiro/skills/*/SKILL.md` to match your team's processes
- **Adjust steering rules** in `.kiro/steering/*.md` to enforce your coding standards
- **Toggle or edit hooks** in `.kiro/hooks/*.json` to automate your workflow
- **Customize scripts** in `.kiro/scripts/*.sh` to match your tooling setup

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with planning**: Use the `planner` agent to break down complex features
2. **Write tests first**: Invoke the `tdd-workflow` skill before implementing
3. **Review your code**: Switch to `code-reviewer` agent after writing code
4. **Check security**: Use `security-reviewer` agent for auth, API endpoints, or sensitive data handling
5. **Run quality gate**: Trigger the `quality-gate` hook before committing
6. **Verify comprehensively**: Use the `verification-loop` skill before creating PRs

The auto-loaded steering files (coding-style, security, testing) ensure consistent standards throughout your session.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Building a New Feature with TDD

```bash
# 1. Start with the planner agent to break down the feature
kiro-cli --agent planner
> "I need to add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# 2. Invoke the TDD workflow skill
> /tdd-workflow

# 3. Follow the TDD cycle: write tests first, then implementation
# The tdd-workflow skill will guide you through:
# - Writing unit tests for auth logic
# - Writing integration tests for API endpoints
# - Writing E2E tests for login flow

# 4. Switch to code-reviewer after implementation
> /agent swap code-reviewer
> "Review the authentication implementation"

# 5. Run security review for auth-related code
> /agent swap security-reviewer
> "Check for security vulnerabilities in the auth system"

# 6. Trigger quality gate before committing
# (In IDE: Click the quality-gate hook in Agent Hooks panel)
```

### Example 2: Code Review Workflow

```bash
# 1. Switch to code-reviewer agent
kiro-cli --agent code-reviewer

# 2. Review specific files or directories
> "Review the changes in src/api/users.ts"

# 3. Use the verification-loop skill for comprehensive checks
> /verification-loop

# 4. The verification loop will:
# - Run build and type checks
# - Run linter
# - Run all tests
# - Perform security scan
# - Review git diff
# - Iterate until all checks pass
```

### Example 3: Security-First Development

```bash
# 1. Invoke security-review skill when working on sensitive features
> /security-review

# 2. The skill provides a comprehensive checklist:
# - Input validation and sanitization
# - Authentication and authorization
# - Secret management
# - SQL injection prevention
# - XSS prevention
# - CSRF protection

# 3. Switch to security-reviewer agent for deep analysis
> /agent swap security-reviewer
> "Analyze the API endpoints for security vulnerabilities"

# 4. The security.md steering file is auto-loaded, ensuring:
# - No hardcoded secrets
# - Proper error handling
# - Secure crypto usage
# - OWASP Top 10 compliance
```

### Example 4: Language-Specific Development

```bash
# For Go projects:
kiro-cli --agent go-reviewer
> "Review the concurrency patterns in this service"
> /golang-patterns  # Invoke Go-specific patterns skill

# For Python projects:
kiro-cli --agent python-reviewer
> "Review the type hints and error handling"
> /python-patterns  # Invoke Python-specific patterns skill

# Language-specific steering files are auto-loaded:
# - golang-patterns.md loads when editing .go files
# - python-patterns.md loads when editing .py files
# - typescript-patterns.md loads when editing .ts/.tsx files
```

### Example 5: Using Hooks for Automation

```bash
# Hooks run automatically based on triggers:

# 1. typecheck-on-edit hook
# - Triggers when you save .ts or .tsx files
# - Agent checks for type errors inline, no terminal spawned

# 2. console-log-check hook
# - Triggers when you save .js, .ts, or .tsx files
# - Agent flags console.log statements and offers to remove them

# 3. tdd-reminder hook
# - Triggers when you create a new .ts or .tsx file
# - Reminds you to write tests first
# - Reinforces TDD discipline

# 4. extract-patterns hook
# - Runs when agent stops working
# - Suggests patterns to add to lessons-learned.md
# - Builds your team's knowledge base over time

# Toggle hooks on/off in the Agent Hooks panel (IDE)
# or disable them in the hook JSON files
```

### Example 6: Manual Context Modes

```bash
# Use manual steering files for specific contexts:

# Development mode - focused on implementation
> #dev-mode
> "Implement the user registration endpoint"

# Review mode - thorough code review
> #review-mode
> "Review all changes in the current PR"

# Research mode - exploration and learning
> #research-mode
> "Explain how the authentication system works"

# Manual steering files provide context-specific instructions
# without cluttering every conversation
```

### Example 7: Database Work

```bash
# 1. Use database-reviewer agent for schema work
kiro-cli --agent database-reviewer
> "Review the database schema for the users table"

# 2. Invoke database-migrations skill
> /database-migrations

# 3. For PostgreSQL-specific work
> /postgres-patterns
> "Optimize this query for better performance"

# 4. The database-reviewer checks:
# - Schema design and normalization
# - Index usage and performance
# - Migration safety
# - SQL injection vulnerabilities
```

### Example 8: Building and Deploying

```bash
# 1. Fix build errors with build-error-resolver
kiro-cli --agent build-error-resolver
> "Fix the TypeScript compilation errors"

# 2. Use docker-patterns skill for containerization
> /docker-patterns
> "Create a production-ready Dockerfile"

# 3. Use deployment-patterns skill for CI/CD
> /deployment-patterns
> "Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for deployment"

# 4. Run quality gate before deployment
# (Trigger quality-gate hook to run all checks)
```

### Example 9: Refactoring and Cleanup

```bash
# 1. Use refactor-cleaner agent for safe refactoring
kiro-cli --agent refactor-cleaner
> "Remove unused code and consolidate duplicate functions"

# 2. The agent will:
# - Identify dead code
# - Find duplicate implementations
# - Suggest consolidation opportunities
# - Refactor safely without breaking changes

# 3. Use verification-loop after refactoring
> /verification-loop
# Ensures all tests still pass after refactoring
```

### Example 10: Documentation Updates

```bash
# 1. Use doc-updater agent for documentation work
kiro-cli --agent doc-updater
> "Update the README with the new API endpoints"

# 2. The agent will:
# - Update codemaps in docs/CODEMAPS/
# - Update README files
# - Generate API documentation
# - Keep docs in sync with code

# 3. doc-file-warning hook prevents accidental doc changes
# - Triggers before writing to documentation files
# - Asks for confirmation
# - Prevents unintentional modifications
```
