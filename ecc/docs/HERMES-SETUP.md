# Hermes x ECC Setup

Hermes is the operator shell. ECC is the reusable system behind it.

This guide is the public, sanitized version of the Hermes stack used to run content, outreach, research, sales ops, finance checks, and engineering workflows from one terminal-native surface.

## What Ships Publicly

- ECC skills, agents, commands, hooks, and MCP configs from this repo
- Hermes-generated workflow skills that are stable enough to reuse
- a documented operator topology for chat, crons, workspace memory, and distribution flows
- launch collateral for sharing the stack publicly

This guide does not include private secrets, live tokens, personal data, or a raw `~/.hermes` export.

## Architecture

Use Hermes as the front door and ECC as the reusable workflow substrate.

```

## Public Workspace Map

Use this as the minimal surface to reproduce the setup without leaking private state.

- `~/.hermes/config.yaml`
  - model routing
  - MCP server registration
  - plugin loading
- `~/.hermes/skills/ecc-imports/`
  - ECC skills copied in for Hermes-native use
- `skills/hermes-generated/`
  - operator patterns distilled from repeated Hermes sessions
- `~/.hermes/plugins/`
  - bridge plugins for hooks, reminders, and workflow-specific tool glue
- `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`
  - scheduled automation runs with explicit prompts and channels
- `~/.hermes/workspace/`
  - business, ops, health, content, and memory artifacts

## Recommended Capability Stack

### Core

- Hermes for chat, cron, orchestration, and workspace state
- ECC for skills, rules, prompts, and cross-harness conventions
- GitHub + Context7 + Exa + Firecrawl + Playwright as the baseline MCP layer

### Content

- FFmpeg for local edit and assembly
- Remotion for programmable clips
- fal.ai for image/video generation
- ElevenLabs for voice, cleanup, and audio packaging
- CapCut or VectCutAPI for final social-native polish

### Business Ops

- Google Drive as the system of record for docs, sheets, decks, and research dumps
- Stripe for revenue and payment operations
- GitHub for engineering execution
- Telegram and iMessage-style channels for urgent nudges and approvals

## What Still Requires Local Auth

These stay local and should be configured per operator:

- Google OAuth token for Drive / Docs / Sheets / Slides
- X / LinkedIn / outbound distribution credentials
- Stripe keys
- browser automation credentials and stealth/proxy settings
- any CRM or project system credentials such as Linear or Apollo
- Apple Health export or ingest path if health automations are enabled

## Suggested Bring-Up Order

0. Run `ecc migrate audit --source ~/.hermes` first to inventory the legacy workspace and see which parts already map onto ECC2.
0.5. Plan and scaffold migration artifacts before importing anything:
   - generate reviewable plans with `ecc migrate plan` and `ecc migrate scaffold`
   - scaffold reusable legacy skills with `ecc migrate import-skills --output-dir migration-artifacts/skills`
   - scaffold tool translation templates with `ecc migrate import-tools --output-dir migration-artifacts/tools`
   - scaffold bridge plugin templates with `ecc migrate import-plugins --output-dir migration-artifacts/plugins`
   - preview recurring jobs with `ecc migrate import-schedules --dry-run`
   - preview gateway dispatch with `ecc migrate import-remote --dry-run`
   - preview safe env/service context with `ecc migrate import-env --dry-run`
   - import sanitized workspace memory with `ecc migrate import-memory`
1. Install ECC and verify the baseline harness setup with `node tests/run-all.js`; the expected result is a zero-failure test summary.
2. Install Hermes and point it at ECC-imported skills.
3. Register the MCP servers you actually use every day.
4. Authenticate Google Drive first, then GitHub, then distribution channels.
5. Start with a small cron surface: readiness check, content accountability, inbox triage, revenue monitor.
6. Only then add heavier personal workflows like health, relationship graphing, or outbound sequencing.

## Why Hermes x ECC

This stack is useful when you want:

- one terminal-native place to run business and engineering operations
- reusable skills instead of one-off prompts
- automation that can nudge, audit, and escalate
- a public repo that shows the system shape without exposing your private operator state

## Public Release Candidate Scope

ECC v2.0.0-rc.1 documents the Hermes surface and ships launch collateral now.

The remaining private pieces can be layered later:

- additional sanitized templates
- richer public examples
- more generated workflow packs
- tighter CRM and Google Workspace integrations
