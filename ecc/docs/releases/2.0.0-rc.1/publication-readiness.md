| Gate | Required evidence | Fresh check | Blocker field | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub release | Tag exists, release notes use final URLs, assets attached if needed | `gh release view v2.0.0-rc.1 --json tagName,url,isPrerelease` | `Blocker: release not found on 2026-05-12` | Release owner | Pending approval |
| npm package | `npm pack --dry-run` has expected files, version matches, rc goes to `next` | `npm pack --dry-run` and `npm publish --tag next --dry-run` where supported | `Blocker: actual publish requires approval; dry run passed with next tag` | Package owner | Dry-run passed |
| Claude plugin | Manifest validates, marketplace JSON points to public repo, install docs match slug | `claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json`; `claude plugin tag .claude-plugin --dry-run`; isolated temp-home install smoke | `Blocker: real tag creation/push requires approval` | Plugin owner | Clean-checkout dry-run and install smoke recorded |
| Codex plugin | Manifest version matches package and docs, repo marketplace points at the plugin root, and OpenAI's current official Plugin Directory status is recorded | `node tests/docs/ecc2-release-surface.test.js`; `node tests/plugin-manifest.test.js`; `codex plugin marketplace add --help`; temp-home `codex plugin marketplace add <local-checkout>` | `Blocker: official Plugin Directory listing requires OpenAI submission/listing evidence` | Plugin owner | Repo-marketplace distribution verified; official directory pending |

| ECC Tools billing reference | Any billing claim links to verified Marketplace/App state | `env -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh repo view ECC-Tools/ECC-Tools --json nameWithOwner,isPrivate,viewerPermission` plus internal `/api/billing/readiness?selectReadyTarget=1` readback using the operator bearer path | `Ready: ECC-Tools #92 main CI and ECC-Tools #93 main CI passed; live selected-target readback returned announcementGate.ready === true on 2026-05-20; repeat before payment announcement` | ECC Tools owner | Billing evidence ready; final copy still waits on release/plugin/live URL approvals |
| Announcement copy | X, LinkedIn, GitHub release, and longform copy point to live URLs | placeholder-marker scan and `release-url-ledger-2026-05-19.md` | `Blocker: final live release/npm/plugin/billing URLs do not exist yet; live and pending URLs are separated in the May 19 ledger` | Release owner | URL ledger recorded; final URLs pending |
| Privileged workflow hardening | Release and maintenance workflows avoid persisted checkout tokens | `node scripts/ci/validate-workflow-security.js` | `Blocker:` | Release owner | Evidence recorded in post-hardening refresh |

## Required Command Evidence

Record the exact commit SHA and command output before any publication action:

| Evidence | Command | Required result | Recorded output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clean release branch | `git status --short --branch` | On intended release commit; no unrelated files | Current May 20 baseline `c2471fe5c535310f8a8008c9ed7ea9f6757b33f2`: `## main...origin/main`; repeat from the exact final publication commit before release |
| Preview-pack smoke | `npm run preview-pack:smoke` | Preview pack artifacts, Hermes boundary, final verification command list, and publication blockers pass | `publication-evidence-2026-05-19.md`: ready yes, digest `eebb8a66c33e`, 33 artifacts, 5 passed, 0 failed; repeat in the final strict clean-checkout release pass |
| Release approval gate | `npm run release:approval-gate -- --format json` | Ready true only after owner decision rows are approved, live release/package/plugin/video/billing URLs are recorded, and launch/outbound copy has no placeholders or private paths | Current May 19 state is intentionally blocked because owner decisions and live URL readbacks remain approval-gated |
| Harness audit | `npm run harness:audit -- --format json` | 80/80 passing | Current release gate: 80/80 across 8 applicable categories, 0 top actions |
| Adapter scorecard | `npm run harness:adapters -- --check` | PASS | Current release gate: PASS, 11 adapters |
| Observability readiness | `npm run observability:ready` | 21/21 passing | Current release gate: 21/21, ready true |
| Release safety gate | `npm run observability:ready -- --format json` | Release Safety category passing with publication readiness, supply-chain, workflow security, package surface, and release-surface evidence | Current release gate keeps Release Safety passing at 3/3; repeat the JSON gate from the exact final release commit |
| Supply-chain verification | `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`; `npm audit signatures`; `yarn install --immutable --mode=skip-build`; `cd ecc2 && cargo audit -q`; Dependabot alerts; GitGuardian Security Checks | 0 vulnerabilities/alerts, registry signatures verified, package-manager locks accepted, GitGuardian clean | Current supply-chain branch: `npm audit` found 0 vulnerabilities; `npm audit signatures` verified 254 registry signatures and 30 attestations; Yarn immutable install accepted the lock after pinning `@types/node@25.7.0` and moving `brace-expansion` to `5.0.6` / `1.1.14`; PR #2008 CI `26108473648`, post-PR #2006 main CI `26109953093`, PR #2009 CI `26111313938`, and post-PR #2009 main CI `26111946778` completed with 0 failures |
| Root suite | `node tests/run-all.js` | 0 failures | Current May 19 local suite: 2568 passed, 0 failed before PR #2013 merged; post-PR #2009 focused regressions also passed for worktree detection, observe subdirectory/global fallback, project maintenance CLI, and the hooks suite |
| Markdown lint | `npx markdownlint-cli '**/*.md' --ignore node_modules` | 0 failures | Current release gate: focused lint passed for `publication-readiness.md`, `publication-evidence-2026-05-19.md`, and `docs/ECC-2.0-GA-ROADMAP.md` |
| Package surface | `node tests/scripts/npm-publish-surface.test.js` | 0 failures; no Python bytecode in npm tarball | Current release gate: 2/2 passed |
| Release surface | `node tests/docs/ecc2-release-surface.test.js` | 0 failures | Current release gate: 27/27 passed after refreshing the discussion-count assertion to the post-PR #2005 baseline |
| Optional Rust surface | `cd ecc2 && cargo test` | 0 failures or explicit deferral | `publication-evidence-2026-05-16.md`: 462/462 passed, existing warnings only |
| Queue baseline | `node scripts/platform-audit.js --json` across trunk, AgentShield, JARVIS, ECC Tools, and ECC website | Under 20 open PRs and under 20 open issues | Current May 20 baseline after PR #2020: platform audit ready true, 0 open PRs, 0 open issues, 0 discussion gaps, 0 conflicting PRs, and 0 blocking dirty files across tracked repos |
| Discussion baseline | `node scripts/platform-audit.js --json` and `node scripts/discussion-audit.js --json` | No unmanaged active discussion queue and no answerable Q&A missing an accepted answer | Post-PR #2005 baseline: platform audit sampled 59 trunk discussions, 0 needing maintainer touch, 0 answerable discussions missing accepted answer; `docs/architecture/discussion-response-playbook.md` records response templates and security escalation rules |
| Linear roadmap | Linear project and issue readback | Detailed roadmap exists with release, security, AgentShield, ECC Tools, legacy, and observability lanes | May 18 Linear comments include ITO-57 `3fe5b2b7-c4fe-401c-a317-b40d72119cb3` and ITO-44 `fb4a4f33-6c2d-421a-bbdb-63cfad3e3ee4`; earlier evidence records the project and 16 issue lanes |
| Operator readiness dashboard | `npm run operator:dashboard -- --json` | Current queue state mapped to macro-goal deliverables and incomplete gaps | Current May 20 dashboard is refreshed from the post-PR #2020 baseline; platform audit ready true, 0 open PRs, 0 open issues, 0 discussion gaps, 0 dirty files, release video suite current, selected-target billing/env-file path mirrored, and publication gates still approval-gated |
| Release URL ledger | `docs/releases/2.0.0-rc.1/release-url-ledger-2026-05-19.md` plus placeholder-marker scan | Live links and approval-gated links are separated before announcement copy is posted | Ledger records public repo/docs/npm/OpenAI Codex documentation URLs and blocks GitHub release/npm/plugin/billing/social URLs until approval-gated checks pass |
| Release name and plugin publication checklist | `docs/releases/2.0.0-rc.1/release-name-plugin-publication-checklist-2026-05-18.md` | Name/package/plugin values are frozen, final-release commands are listed, and Claude/Codex publication paths cite current official docs | Checklist keeps `ECC`, `ecc-universal`, and plugin slug `ecc` for rc.1; no npm rename, npm publish, plugin tag, official listing, billing claim, or announcement before final evidence |

## Do Not Publish If

- `main` has unreviewed release-surface changes after the evidence was recorded.
- `npm view ecc-universal dist-tags --json` contradicts the intended rc/GA tag.
- Claude plugin validation is unavailable or no clean-checkout install smoke
  test is recorded for the intended release commit.
- Release notes or announcement drafts still contain placeholder URLs,
  `TODO`, `TBD`, private workspace paths, or personal operator references.
- Billing, Marketplace, or plugin-submission copy claims a live surface before
  the live URL exists.
- Stale PR salvage work is mid-flight on the same branch.

## Announcement Order

1. Merge the release-version PR.
2. Record the required command evidence from the release commit.
3. Create or verify the GitHub prerelease.
4. Publish npm with the rc dist-tag.
5. Submit or update plugin marketplace surfaces.
6. Regenerate the release URL ledger and update release notes with final live
   URLs.
7. Publish GitHub release copy.
8. Publish X, LinkedIn, and longform copy only after the public URLs work.
