# ECC v2.0.0-rc.1 Preview Pack Manifest

This manifest defines the reviewed preview pack for `2.0.0-rc.1`. It is not a
release action by itself. Use it to verify that the public launch surface is
assembled before creating the GitHub prerelease, publishing npm, tagging plugin
surfaces, or posting announcements.

## Itô Skill Pack Boundary

The preview pack includes six public teaser skills for prediction-market and
Itô-adjacent workflows:

- `skills/ito-market-intelligence/SKILL.md`
- `skills/ito-basket-compare/SKILL.md`
- `skills/ito-trade-planner/SKILL.md`
- `skills/ito-data-atlas-agent/SKILL.md`
- `skills/prediction-market-oracle-research/SKILL.md`
- `skills/prediction-market-risk-review/SKILL.md`

They are research, comparison, planning, and risk-review skills. They do not
place trades, do not provide investment advice, and do not merge ECC Tools with
Itô. Any Itô-backed data call requires explicit gated API access through
`ITO_API_KEY`.

## Hermes Skill Boundary

The preview pack includes one public Hermes-specialized skill:

- `skills/hermes-imports/SKILL.md`

That is intentional for rc.1. The skill is a sanitization and conversion
workflow, not a dump of private Hermes automations. Additional Hermes-generated
skills should enter ECC only after they pass the same rules:

- no raw workspace exports;
- no live account names, client data, finance data, CRM data, health data, or
  private contact graph;
- provider requirements described by capability, not by secret value;
- repo-relative examples instead of local absolute paths;
- tests or docs proving the workflow is useful without private state.

## Reference-Inspired Adapter Direction

The preview pack uses outside systems as design pressure, not as copy targets:

| Reference pressure | ECC preview-pack interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Native plugin, skills, commands, hooks, MCP conventions, and statusline-oriented workflows |
| Codex | Instruction-backed plugin metadata, shared skills, MCP reference config, and explicit hook-parity caveats |
| OpenCode | Adapter-backed package/plugin surface with shared hook logic at the edge |
| Zed-adjacent tools | Instruction-backed portability until a verified native adapter exists |
| dmux | Session/runtime orchestration signals and handoff exports, not a replacement for repo validation |
| Orca, Superset, Ghast | Reference-only pressure for worktree lifecycle, session grouping, notifications, and workspace presets |
| Hermes Agent, meta-harness, autocontext-style systems | Evaluation, memory, and context-routing pressure routed through public artifacts, verifier outputs, and the evaluator/RAG prototype |

## Final Verification Commands

Run these from the exact release commit before publication:

```bash
git status --short --branch
node scripts/platform-audit.js --json
npm run preview-pack:smoke
npm run release:approval-gate -- --format json
npm run release:video-suite -- --format json
npm run harness:adapters -- --check
npm run harness:audit -- --format json
npm run observability:ready
npm run security:ioc-scan
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
npm audit signatures
node tests/docs/ecc2-release-surface.test.js
node tests/run-all.js
cd ecc2 && cargo test
```

## Publication Blockers

The preview pack is assembled, but publication is still blocked until these live
surfaces exist and are recorded in a final evidence file:

- final release URL ledger regenerated from the intended release commit;
- `npm run release:approval-gate -- --format json` returning ready true after
  owner approvals and live URL readbacks are recorded;
- final release name/plugin publication checklist rerun from the intended
  release commit;
- GitHub prerelease `v2.0.0-rc.1`;
- npm `ecc-universal@2.0.0-rc.1` on the `next` dist-tag;
- Claude plugin tag / marketplace propagation for `ecc@ecc`;
- Codex repo-marketplace distribution evidence plus official Plugin Directory
  availability status;
- final announcement URLs in X, LinkedIn, GitHub release, and longform copy;
- ECC Tools billing/product readiness evidence remains fresh: the May 20
  selected-target KV readback and live announcement gate passed through the
  operator bearer path. Repeat the billing readback and gate immediately before
  any native-payments announcement copy is published.

## Result

The rc.1 preview pack is ready for a final clean-checkout release gate, but not
for public publication without the approval-gated release, package, plugin, and
announcement steps above.
