## Core Workflow

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan` | Restate requirements, assess risks, write step-by-step implementation plan — **waits for your confirm before touching code** |

| `/code-review` | Full code quality, security, and maintainability review of changed files |
| `/build-fix` | Detect and fix build errors — delegates to the right build-resolver agent automatically |
| `/verify` | Run the full verification loop: build → lint → test → type-check |
| `/quality-gate` | Quality gate check against project standards |

---

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Starting a new feature?         → /plan first, then /tdd
Code just written?              → /code-review
Build broken?                   → /build-fix
Need live docs?                 → /docs <library>
Session about to end?           → /save-session or /learn-eval
Resuming next day?              → /resume-session
Context getting heavy?          → /context-budget then /checkpoint
Want to extract what you learned? → /learn-eval then /evolve
Running repeated tasks?         → /loop-start
```
