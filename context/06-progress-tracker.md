## Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Data source | tools.json (no database) | Simplicity, edge-compatible, no DB costs |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + CSS vars | Utility-first, design token system, dark mode |
| Components | shadcn/ui (new-york) | Accessible, customizable, sharp corners match aesthetic |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Workers | Edge performance, free tier, global CDN |
| Auth | Stack Auth (optional) | App works without it, no forced registration |
| Linting | ESLint + Biome | Dual coverage, Biome for speed, ESLint for ecosystem |
| Build | Bun | Fast install and build times |
| Routing | Next.js App Router + route groups | SEO-friendly URLs, category organization without URL impact |

## Known Issues

- PWA disabled due to Cloudflare stability issues
- Some tools are SEO shells with placeholder interactivity (ToolInteractivePlaceholder)
- `src/data/` and `src/hooks/` directories are empty (reserved for future use)
- `src/styles/` directory referenced in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md doesn't exist (tokens are in globals.css)

## Next Priorities

1. Convert high-traffic tool placeholders to full implementations
2. Expand blog content for long-tail keywords
3. Improve Core Web Vitals scores
4. Add more structured data types (Product, HowTo expanded)
5. Monitor and fix Search Console errors
